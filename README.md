This project is a Content-Based Movie Recommendation System built using Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn. 
It analyzes movie metadata (such as genres and overviews) to suggest similar movies based on user selection. 
The system uses CountVectorizer and cosine similarity to compute movie similarity scores. 
A simple and interactive Streamlit web app allows users to select a movie and get relevant recommendations instantly.
